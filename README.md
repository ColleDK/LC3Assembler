# LC3Assembler
This project is a LC3 instruction to binary converter made as a project for the course "Machine programming" at the Technical University of Denmark.


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM:
The program will search for a file with .asm extension that must be from an LC3 assembly language. Output will be a .bin file that will have the full binary code of the assembly program.
NOTE! this program does not implement commenting in the assembly code and will crash if used.



This project is not to be used as plagerism and is only meant to be helpful for future students
